# Posters and Demos
The Posters & Demos Track provides a platform for researchers to showcase their latest findings, ongoing projects, and cutting-edge work in progress. These include submissions on innovative applications, latest results, unpublished ideas, prototypes of semantic technologies and their use in various domains as well as applications, use cases or pieces of code that may attract developers and potential research or business partners. This also concerns new datasets made publicly available.  
The Posters & Demos Track offers an informal setting that promotes engagement and dialogue between presenters and attendees. These discussions can provide valuable feedback for presenters' future work, while also allowing participants to gain insight into emerging research trends and network with other researchers.

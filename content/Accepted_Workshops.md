# International Workshop on Semantic Materials Science: Harnessing the Power of Semantic Web (SeMats)
<p style="text-align: justify !important;">Advanced technological solutions are pivotal for leveraging data in innovative research, but compatibility issues in scientific data hinder progress. Interoperability and efficient data access are crucial, and the Semantic Web emerges as a powerful solution. Historically, the intersection  between Semantic Web (SW) technologies, and Materials Science and Engineering (MSE) dates back before the formalization of the Semantic  Web concept in 2001. For instance, the creation of the Plinius ontology in 1994 provided a language-independent conceptual construction  kit for the chemical composition of materials. Recent conferences in the MSE domain, such as the FEMS-Euromat (European Congress and Exhibition on Advanced Materials and Processes) and MSE congress, show a significant increase in Semantic Web applications, with over ten SW-related presentations in 2022 and more than 20 in 2023. This growing  adoption prompts a focus on attracting participants at the intersection of both areas. The Semantic Web, widely adopted in life sciences, proves beneficial in Materials Science Engineering. Expanding Semantic  Web technologies to the Materials Science domain can enhance research outcomes by enabling the uniform consideration of heterogeneous data.  It improves traceability and reproducibility and facilitates automatable data management solutions. The primary objective of the proposed workshop is to gather works applying Semantic Web Technologies in  Materials Science, making these technologies accessible to a broader community. The workshop aims to provide an overview of existing  approaches, identify relevant works, and bring together Materials Science and Semantic Web stakeholders for collaboration and innovation. Join us in exploring the transformative possibilities of Semantic Web Technologies in Materials Science, paving the way for a more interconnected and efficient research landscape.</p>

# 3rd NLP4KGC: Natural Language Processing for Knowledge 
<p style="text-align: justify !important;">Building a domain knowledge graph from a large amount of text requires a tremendous amount of work, including entity recognition, entity disambiguation and relationship extraction. Because of this, more work has been done on automated ways to generate knowledge graphs from text. Recent efforts in NLP (Natural Language Processing) development have shown that semantic deep neural networks can learn the complex syntactic and semantics of the natural language and thus, give more potential for automation even in the most complex domains i.e., legal documents. New approaches to KG development use a combination of extraction methods and state-of-the-art NLP techniques. Additionally, the advancement of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are able to learn powerful embeddings which leverage topological structures in the KGs and provide explanations of the outcome. Despite the successes this existing research has achieved, deep learning on graphs for NLP still faces many challenges. Presentation of challenges faced in specific domains such as Science, Sustainability is also welcomed. For instance, in the sciences, the production of resources (e.g., publications) is growing at a rate that outstrips an individual’s capacity to discovery and utilize them. As a result, alongside manual methods to structure and make discoverable that knowledge, automation is vital. We welcome applications that analyze and synthesize large volumes of scientific information (especially scientific literature, notes documents, and dataset metadata) and can use that information to create ontologies and semantic representations that better organize them. We also welcome contributions that address automation components of maintenance of ontologies and knowledge graphs. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify !important;">This workshop invites contributions on methods and approaches of knowledge and data extraction from text, as well as theoretical and practical aspects of using semantic deep NLP for KG creation and the use of such KG for Graph Neural Network (GNN) tasks.</p>

# Large Language Models and Knowledge Graphs unified: use cases and examples
<p style="text-align: justify !important;">Large Language models (LLMs) and Generative AI have changed drastically the way we look at knowledge representation and use. Many organizations are investigating how to generate business value from the combination of the two words; LLMs and Knowledge Graphs (KGs). Responsible AI is a key topic of discussion. As with data, it is not only an asset that can be used, but also a liability that needs to be managed. Concerns like biases and hallucinations are hard problems to be solved. On the other hand, KGs are well understood and widely used concepts for knowledge representation. They do not suffer from the aforementioned concerns, but the flip side is that maintaining KGs is often a task which requires considerable human effort and using KGs is often harder than using LLMs.This workshop is all about combining LLMs and KGs. It focusses on real-life, practical use-cases that industry (both commercial and governmental organizations) are currently working on. All talks are presented by invited speakers from industry and research organizations and will present what works in a practical setting to add business value and use AI in a responsible way.
You can expect discussions on use cases like:

	<li><p style="text-align: justify !important;">Using KGs as data for RAG (Retrieval augmented generation) LLMs</p></li>

# NXDG: NeXt-Generation Data Governance 
<p style="text-align: justify !important;">It's 2024 and we still can't visit any website without clicking "Yes" on a cookie banner, exchanging access to our most private data for the right to browse around. Managing and enforcing our privacy preferences in a personalised manner is also quite challenging. Additionally, data protection laws are emerging exponentially following in the footsteps of the GDPR. In this context, the NeXt-generation Data Governance 2024 workshop aims to bring together technical, legal and societal researchers, and industry experts to discuss data governance, emergence of data spaces and the impact of the European strategy for data in such systems. The workshop aims to support the development of solutions to manage data, policies and provenance in a trustful and interoperable manner and to aid in the management and reporting of legal documentation falling from the EU’s GDPR for data protection and the DGA, Data Act, AI Act and EHDS to create legally-aligned, AI-powered data ecosystems, using semantic-based specifications such as ODRL, DPV or Solid. As such, this workshop will have presentations and discussions of interest to both data providers and consumers, researchers, standardisation bodies, businesses, and citizens who want to interoperate in the Data Spaces era. </p>

## The Ultimate Guide to Semantic Reasoning: How to enrich your data for practical applications including use with RAG & LLMs. Peter Crocker, Valerio Cocchi and Thomas Vout.

## Description:
<p>
Semantic reasoning is fast becoming a must-have for anyone running a knowledge graph application as a route to better data, faster queries, and ultimately greater insights. With ever-improving
technology, these benefits are no longer for an exclusive few and are instead widely accessible, and
yet, many in the industry still lack the knowledge and understanding to fully capture the power of
reasoning.
Join this Ultimate Guide to Semantic Reasoning to learn the best practices of rule writing and how to
use it to supercharge applications. Use the W3C standard, OWL, for ontological reasoning, and the
widely used Datalog for more advanced functionality such as aggregation, negation, and filtering to
build a working solution live in the workshop.
Discover how this enriched data, coupled with the advanced automation feature of incremental
reasoning, is enabling real-world applications, including how to enhance RAG and LLM-based
solutions. For beginners and experts alike, no prior knowledge is required

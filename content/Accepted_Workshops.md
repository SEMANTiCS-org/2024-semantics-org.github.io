# International Workshop on Semantic Materials Science: Harnessing the Power of Semantic Web (SeMats)
<p style="text-align: justify !important;">Advanced technological solutions are pivotal for leveraging data in innovative research, but compatibility issues in scientific data hinder progress. Interoperability and efficient data access are crucial, and the Semantic Web emerges as a powerful solution. Historically, the intersection  between Semantic Web (SW) technologies, and Materials Science and Engineering (MSE) dates back before the formalization of the Semantic  Web concept in 2001. For instance, the creation of the Plinius ontology in 1994 provided a language-independent conceptual construction  kit for the chemical composition of materials. Recent conferences in the MSE domain, such as the FEMS-Euromat (European Congress and Exhibition on Advanced Materials and Processes) and MSE congress, show a significant increase in Semantic Web applications, with over ten SW-related presentations in 2022 and more than 20 in 2023. This growing  adoption prompts a focus on attracting participants at the intersection of both areas. The Semantic Web, widely adopted in life sciences, proves beneficial in Materials Science Engineering [1]. Expanding Semantic  Web technologies to the Materials Science domain can enhance research outcomes by enabling the uniform consideration of heterogeneous data.  It improves traceability and reproducibility and facilitates automatable data management solutions. The primary objective of the proposed workshop is to gather works applying Semantic Web Technologies in  Materials Science, making these technologies accessible to a broader community. The workshop aims to provide an overview of existing  approaches, identify relevant works, and bring together Materials Science and Semantic Web stakeholders for collaboration and innovation. Join us in exploring the transformative possibilities of Semantic Web Technologies in Materials Science, paving the way for a more interconnected and efficient research landscape.</p>

# 3rd NLP4KGC: Natural Language Processing for Knowledge 
<p style="text-align: justify !important;">Building a domain knowledge graph from a large amount of text requires a tremendous amount of work, including entity recognition, entity disambiguation and relationship extraction. Because of this, more work has been done on automated ways to generate knowledge graphs from text. Recent efforts in NLP (Natural Language Processing) development have shown that semantic deep neural networks can learn the complex syntactic and semantics of the natural language and thus, give more potential for automation even in the most complex domains i.e., legal documents. New approaches to KG development use a combination of extraction methods and state-of-the-art NLP techniques. Additionally, the advancement of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are able to learn powerful embeddings which leverage topological structures in the KGs and provide explanations of the outcome. Despite the successes this existing research has achieved, deep learning on graphs for NLP still faces many challenges. Presentation of challenges faced in specific domains such as Science, Sustainability is also welcomed. For instance, in the sciences, the production of resources (e.g., publications) is growing at a rate that outstrips an individual’s capacity to discovery and utilize them. As a result, alongside manual methods to structure and make discoverable that knowledge, automation is vital. We welcome applications that analyze and synthesize large volumes of scientific information (especially scientific literature, notes documents, and dataset metadata) and can use that information to create ontologies and semantic representations that better organize them. We also welcome contributions that address automation components of maintenance of ontologies and knowledge graphs. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify !important;">This workshop invites contributions on methods and approaches of knowledge and data extraction from text, as well as theoretical and practical aspects of using semantic deep NLP for KG creation and the use of such KG for Graph Neural Network (GNN) tasks.</p>
